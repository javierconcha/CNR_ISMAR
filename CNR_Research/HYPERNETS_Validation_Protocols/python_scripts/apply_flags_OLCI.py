#%% Flags values
'''
INVALID = Invalid flag: instrument data missing or invalid
WATER = Water (marine) with clear sky conditions, i.e. no clouds
CLOUD = Cloudy pixel
CLOUD_AMIBUOUS = Possibly a cloudy pixel, the flag removes semi-transparent clouds and other ambiguous cloud signatures
CLOUD_MARGIN = Cloud edge pixel, the flag provides an a-priori margin on the ‘CLOUD or CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS’ flag of 2 pixels at RR and 4 pixels at FR
SNOW_ICE = Possible sea-ice or snow contamination
INLAND_WATER = Fresh inland waters flag (from L1B); these pixels will also be flagged as LAND rather than WATER.
TIDAL = Pixel is in a tidal zone (from L1B)
COSMETIC = Cosmetic flag (from L1B)
SUSPECT = Suspect flag (from L1B)
HISOLZEN = High solar zenith: SZA > 70°
SATURATED = Saturation flag: saturated within any band from 400 to 754 nm or in bands 779, 865, 885 and 1020 nm
MEGLINT = Flag for pixels corrected for sun glint
HIGHGLINT = Flag for when the sun glint correction is not reliable
WHITECAPS = Flag for when the sea surface is rough enough for there to be whitecaps, which cause a brightening of the water-leaving reflectance
ADJAC = reserved for future use for an adjacency correction, so always set to false
WV_FAIL = IWV retrieval algorithm failed
AC_FAIL = BAC atmospheric correction is suspect
OC4ME_FAIL = OC4Me algorithm failed 
OCNN_FAIL = NN algorithm failed
KDM_ FAIL = KD490 algorithm failed

BPAC_ON = Bright Pixel Correction converged and a NIR signal was determined
WHITE_SCATT = "White" scatterer within the water e.g. coccoliths
LOWRW = Water-leaving reflectance at 560 nm is less than a defined threshold or HIINLD_F raised (flag for low pressure water i.e., high altitude inland waters)
HIGHRW = High water-leaving reflectance at 560 nm or the TSM retrieved as part of the BPAC is above a threshold
ANNOT = Annotation flags for the quality of the atmospheric correction, including:
      ANNOT_ANGSTROM (Ångström exponent cannot be computed);
      ANNOT_AERO_B (blue aerosols);
      ANNOT_ABSO_D (desert dust absorbing aerosols);
      ANNOT_ACLIM (aerosol model does not match aerosol climatology);
      ANNOT_ABSOA (absorbing aerosols);
      ANNOT_MIXR1 (aerosol mixing ratio is equal to 0 or 1);
      ANNOT_DROUT (minimum absolute value of the reflectance error at 510 nm is greater than a defined threshold);
      ANNOT_TAU06 (aerosol optical thickness is greater than a defined threshold)
RWNEG_O01 to RWNEG_O21 = Provides a "negative water-leaving reflectance" flag for each band’s water-leaving reflectance: the value below which pixels are flagged varies according to the band, with the threshold stored within a Look-Up Table
