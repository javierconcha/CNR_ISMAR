from port installation:
--->  Some of the ports you installed have notes:
  hdf5 has the following notes:
    Mac users may need to set the environment variable "HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING" to the
    five-character string "FALSE" when accessing network mounted files.  This is an
    application run-time setting, not a configure or build setting.  Otherwise errors such
    as "unable to open file" or "HDF5 error" may be  encountered.
  libidn has the following notes:
    Please be aware that GNU libidn2 is the successor of GNU libidn. It comes with IDNA
    2008  
    and TR46 implementations and also provides a compatibility layer for GNU libidn.
  libpsl has the following notes:
    libpsl API documentation is provided by the port 'libpsl-docs'.
  netcdf has the following notes:
    As of version 4.2 c++ and fortran interfaces are separate ports, netcdf-cxx and
    netcdf-fortran, respectively.
  wget has the following notes:
    To customize wget, you can copy /opt/local/etc/wgetrc.sample to /opt/local/etc/wgetrc
    and then make changes.
