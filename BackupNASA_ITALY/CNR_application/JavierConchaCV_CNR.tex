\section{RESEARCH INTERESTS}
Since my Ph.D., I’ve been exploring the use of several observation classes (e.g. MODIS/Aqua, Sentinel-3A/MSI, Landsat-8/OLI, COMS/GOCI) for studying processes at different spatial and temporal scales over optically complex waters. I have experience working with high spatial resolution sensors (i.e. Landsat-8/OLI) over inland waters from my Ph.D. thesis and medium spatial resolution sensors over coastal water from my Postdoc (i.e. COMS/GOCI). Currently, I am working on the inclusion of Sentinel 3 A and B Full Resolution (FR) data streams in the CMEMS catalogue. I am also involved in the validation protocols for the H2020 HYPERNETS project, a new generation of hyperspectral instruments for satellite data validation and calibration. I am currently studying quantitatively the influence of the different validation approaches on the reported validation statistics.
Scientific Research Interests:
I am interested in the calibration of satellite sensors and in developing, improving and validating Ocean Colour algorithms over optically complex water bodies. I use satellite sensors with diverse spatial, temporal and spectral resolution to study processes occurring a different scales. For instance, I have used high spatial resolution sensors (i.e. Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2/MSI) over inland waters, and geostationary sensors (i.e. COMS/GOCI) to study diurnal biogeochemical processes in coastal waters.
